# Snake-game-using-python
The following is an example game written in Python based on the game called 'snake' which has been around since the earliest days of home computing and has re-emerged in recent years on mobile phones.

It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively Python program, and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting games of your own.
